*The Ducati Power Management sub-system uses a structure called RCB_struct or
*just RCB to share information with the MPU about a particular resource involved
*in the communication. The information stored in this structure is needed to get
*attributes and other useful data about the resource.
*The fisrt fields of the RCB resemble the Rcb message sent across the NotifyDver
*It retains the rcb_num, msg_type and msg_subtype from the rcb message as its
*first 3 fields. The rqst_cpu fields indicates which remote processor originates
*the request/release petition. When a particular resource is requested, some of
*its parameters should be specify.
*For devices like Gptimer and GPIO, the most significant attribute its itemID.
*This value should be placed in the "fill9" field of the Rcb sruct. This field
*should be fill by the requester if asking for a particular resource or by the
*receiver if the resource granted is other than the one asked.
*
*Other variables related with the resource are:
*"sem_hnd" which storage the semaphore handle associated in the ducati side.
*We are pending on this semaphore when asked for the resource and
*posted when granted.
*"mod_base_addr". It is the virtual base addres for the resource.
*"process_id". It is the Task Id where the petition for the resource was called.
*
*The last 16 bytes of the structure could be interpreted in 3 different ways
*according to the context.
*1) For the case of the Rcb is for SDMA. The last 16 bytes correspond to a array
*  of 16 channels[ ]. Each entry has the number of the SDMA channel granted.
*  As many number of channels indicated in num_chan as many are meaningful
*  in the channels[] array.
*2) If the extd_mem_flag bit is NOT set the 16 last bytes are used as a data[]
*  array. Each entry is 4bytes long so the maximum number of entries is 4.
*3) If the extd_mem_flag bit is NOT set the 16 last bytes are used as an array
*  datax[ ]  3 members Each entry  4bytes long  and one additional field of
*  "extd_mem_hnd" which is a pointer to the continuation of this datax array
