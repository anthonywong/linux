	  This framework adds support for low-level control of a display.
	  This includes support for power.

	  Enable this to be able to choose the drivers for controlling the
	  physical display panel/monitor on some platforms. This not only
	  covers LCD displays for PDAs but also other types of displays
	  such as CRT, TVout etc.

	  To have support for your specific display panel you will have to
	  select the proper drivers which depend on this option.
